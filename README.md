# React crash course

I'm doing a crash course on react and react + redux
This project, is going to be the demo for the course.

### This is the redux part of the project

Actualy, this project does not need redux as a state  provider
Not all project need redux.
As the creator of redux Dan Abramov said, "[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)"
